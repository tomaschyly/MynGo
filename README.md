# MynGo

**NOTICE: This one is on hold/low priority refactor to React with Typescript. I have decided not to continue to use Express inside Electron.**

Database inspection and management system with interactive console.

The idea is to have something similar to [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) or [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/en/) in a desktop app form. It should be easy to manage many Databases and use interactive console to modify them. The target audience for this are mainly Web Developers.

## Installation

1. Download latest release from [here](https://github.com/tomaschyly/MynGo/releases). Win32 is for Windows. Darwin is for MacOS.
2. For Windows, unzip anywhere you want to have the app installed. For MacOS, unzip anywhere, then copy app to your Applications folder.
3. Run the app, optionally create shortcut to use.

## Important Notes

This app is intended to be crossplatform, currently developed and tested on Windows 10 and MacOS. Ubuntu will follow.

App used to use [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as it was originally ment for me to learn using and simultaneously improve in both Electron and Node.js in server environment.

But now app uses [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I am using it to improve my skills with React and to learn to use Typescript.

## How to Use
