# MynGo

Database inspection and management system with interactive console.

The idea is to have something similar to [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) or [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/en/) in a desktop app form. It should be easy to manage many Databases and use interactive console to modify them. The target audience for this are mainly Web Developers.

## Installation

1. Download latest release from [here](https://github.com/tomaschyly/MynGo/releases). Win32 is for Windows. Darwin is for MacOS.
2. For Windows, unzip anywhere you want to have the app installed. For MacOS, unzip anywhere, then copy app to your Applications folder.
3. Run the app, optionally create shortcut to use.

## Important Notes

This app is intended to be crossplatform, currently developed and tested on Windows 10 and MacOS. Ubuntu will follow.

App is using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as it was originally ment for me to learn using and simultaneously improve in both Electron and Node.js in server environment.

App is currently not codesigned which means that on Windows it will ask you once and on MacOS repeatedly for network access.
